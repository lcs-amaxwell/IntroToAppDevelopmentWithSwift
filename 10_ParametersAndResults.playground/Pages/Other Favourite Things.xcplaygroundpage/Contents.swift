 ## Other Favourite Things
 
 The favourite food function you created earlier is OK but perhaps a bit limited. What if you have a favourite animal or a favourite colour?
 The following code is a more flexible version:
 ```
 let categoryOfThing = "food"
 let favourite = "cheese"
 print("My favourite \(categoryOfThing) is \(favourite)")
 ```

 - callout(Exercise): Put the print statement above inside a function that allows you to pass in one string for the category of thing, and another string for your favourite. When you call the function, it should look like this:\
 `printFavourite(categoryOfThing: "food", favourite: "cheese")`
