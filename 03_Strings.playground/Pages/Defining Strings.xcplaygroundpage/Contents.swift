//: ## Defining Strings
//: In the previous playground, you declared number constants like this:
let heightInCentimetres = 7817
//: To declare a string constant, you put text between quotation marks like this:
let favouriteBook = "The Sun Also Rises"

let traditionalGreeting = "Hello, world!"
//: The declared string values also appear in the results sidebar. ðŸ‘‰
//: - experiment: Practise by declaring `favouriteMovie` and `favouriteSong` string constants for your favourite movie and song:
// Declare a favouriteMovie constant


// Declare a favouriteSong constant


//: Next, take a string-based trip around the world.
